# Exact matching dichotomy on a minimal Hurwitz cycle

This file keeps the two notions which must not be conflated separate:
`CICAdapter` records factor ownership, while the relation below records the
literal reactions eligible for a child selection.  Hall's theorem either
selects distinct eligible reactions or returns a cardinality obstruction.
