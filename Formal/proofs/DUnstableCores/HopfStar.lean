# Exact phase localization on a diagonal-branch star

For mutually uncoupled branch vertices, every branch message has a strictly
positive denominator `bᵢ² + ω²`.  The root imaginary equation therefore
forces at least one oppositely signed two-cycle.

Source-faithful star corollary: if all non-root branch interactions are
diagonal, a simple imaginary pair exposes a literal opposite-sign reaction
circuit between the root and one branch species.
