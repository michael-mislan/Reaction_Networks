# Narrow Core-Interaction-Calculus adapter

This file imports only CIC reaction ownership, literal source reconstruction,
typed factor--species incidence, and private/interface semantics.  It does not
identify reaction factors with child selections and makes no D-stability
composition claim.

Every edge of the minimal Hurwitz cycle is a two-sided typed incidence through
the owner of its literal witnessing reaction.  This is the narrow bridge from
the Hopf certificate to CIC; it does not collapse reaction ownership into a
child-selection assignment.
