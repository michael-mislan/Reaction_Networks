# Fractional child-assignment obstruction at the Hopf wall

An injective child assignment uses any reaction at most once.  Consequently,
every convex mixture of such assignments has reaction-row load at most one.
The normalized reactivity of the exact Hopf source violates this capacity at
its shared consumption reaction, locating the information lost by a naive
matching decomposition.
