# T-HARD: final statement with the Pell size bound

`pell_exists N` gives a solution of `p² = 3q² + 1` with `N ≤ q ≤ 4N + 1`; it is produced by the
recursion `(p, q) ↦ (2p + 3q, p + 2q)` started at `(2, 1)`, so `q` has `O(log N)` bits and the
reduction's output has polynomial bit size.  `dStability_partition_reduction` combines this with
`hardness_iff`/`hardness_reduction`.

/-- **Main theorem (T-HARD).** For every PARTITION instance `w` (positive weights, total `2T`)
there is a Pell pair `(p, q)` with `max(8T, 4) ≤ q ≤ 4 max(8T, 4) + 1` such that the explicit
rational star matrix `hardMatrix p q w T` is D-stable iff no subset of `w` sums to `T`, and is
strictly D-unstable (a positive scaling has an eigenvalue with positive real part) otherwise. -/
